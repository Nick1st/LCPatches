# LCPatches

LCPatches is a small coremod, using [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/), that fixes some things in 1.12.2 [Lost Cities Mod](https://github.com/McJtyMods/LostCities/tree/1.12), as this version is not supported anymore by [McJty](https://github.com/McJtyMods).


### Current patches:
- Fix the 'mincellars' option in Lost Cities assets.
- Add '#NOBORDER': Add it somewhere to the name of your Building and this Building won't generate with the filler block border.
- Add '#NOCORRIDORS': Add it somewhere to the name of your Building and this Building won't generate corridors.
- Add '#NODOORS': Add it somewhere to the name of your Building and this Building won't generate doors. Thanks to geza3D.


### Currently worked on:
- Nothing, feel free to stick suggestions on Github!

Most likely this wont get updates anymore. At least not until retrogradle is fully usable. Also, see "[How old is Minecraft 1.12.2 today?](https://howoldisminecraft1122.today/)".

Anyway, feel free to report issues and suggestions on Github!
